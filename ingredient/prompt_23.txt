Create a pixel art asset sheet for a top-down 2D hospital RPG game.

VERY IMPORTANT - CAMERA ANGLE:

This is a BIRD'S EYE VIEW game. The camera is ABOVE the objects, looking DOWN.

CORRECT: We see the TOP SURFACE of every object.
WRONG: We see the FRONT or SIDE of objects.

Think of it like looking down from the ceiling at the floor. Everything is seen from ABOVE.

Reference games with correct view: Pokemon FireRed overworld, RPG Maker VX Ace maps, Stardew Valley farm, Zelda Link to the Past.

Style: Cute pixel art. Transparent background PNG. Label each item with its name below.
