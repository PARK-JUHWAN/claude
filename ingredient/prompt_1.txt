Create a pixel art asset sheet for a top-down 2D hospital RPG game.

VERY IMPORTANT - CAMERA ANGLE:

This is a BIRD'S EYE VIEW game. The camera is ABOVE the objects, looking DOWN.

CORRECT: We see the TOP SURFACE of every object.
WRONG: We see the FRONT or SIDE of objects.

Examples of correct top-down view:
- BED: We see the mattress surface from above. The pillow is a small rectangle at one end. We see the blanket covering the top. The bed frame is just a thin border around the edges.
- CHAIR: We see the seat cushion from above. It looks like a square or circle. We barely see the backrest.
- DESK: We see the desktop surface from above. It looks like a rectangle. We see items ON TOP of the desk.
- CABINET: We see the top surface of the cabinet. The doors are barely visible at the front edge.
- TRASH BIN: We see the circular opening at the top.

Think of it like looking down from the ceiling at the floor. Everything is seen from ABOVE.

Reference games with correct view: Pokemon FireRed overworld, RPG Maker VX Ace maps, Stardew Valley farm, Zelda Link to the Past.

Style: Cute pixel art. Transparent background PNG.
